      **Deals** allow your partners to submit accounts they are working to your
      sales team to avoid channel conflicts and earn commissions for closed
      accounts.
      Typically the Deals experience is handled through a CRM integration like
      Salesforce. However you may opt to use the Deals API to have PartnerStack
      interact with a custom data warehouse rather than directly with your CRM.
